Description of the input parameters
-----------------------------------

Currently, only thin film and bulk models in Cartesian coordinate system with hexahedral cells are supported. The modeling tool can take the following configurations into account:
- Hexahedral bulk superconductor. https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6668/aa69ed
- Rectangular thin film (hexahedral superconductor with one element in the thickness). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2017.05.001
- Multi-filamentary superconductor with normal conductor in between, where each filament is an hexahedron. https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09610
- Stacks of tapes with several elements in the thickness. https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6668/ab5aca
- Thin film disks, cylinders or spheres. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2017.05.001

Building HTStool
-----------------
The code is prepared for Linux (or Unix) operating system and compiles well with the g++ 5.4.0 compiler, and probably also for higher versions. To compile the program and build the executable, run in command-line terminal:

		bash compile.bsh


Running an example
------------------

Once the program is compiled, run with the command-line:

		./main > output.txt

You may edit and save the input file input.txt to change the parameters, or copy the input file from another folder 

Results and graphs
==================

General results
---------------

To see the main results of the program check the output.txt file for AC loss and computing time at the end of file. There are more files with detailed data results and debugging information. It is practical to use the gnuplot graphs below to see the detailed results.

Geometry:
---------

Run the following command in terminal, in order to see geometry structure. You will need to previously install the GNU software gnuplot.

		gnuplot g_1.plt

Screening current density:
--------------------------

Run this command in terminal, in order to see the screening currents in the sample:

		gnuplot 2Dz.plt     

or

		gnuplot 3Dz.plt

Choose options in the 2Dz.plt file: Jx,Jy,J,Bz,...: 0 disable/1 enable to see the corresponding quantities.
Choose options in the 3Dz.plt file: Jx,Jy,J,Jc,...: 0 disable/1 enable to see the corresponding quantities. 

Ac loss:
--------

Run the command below in terminal, in order to see instantaneous AC loss and magnetization in the sample.

		gnuplot loss.plt
